    E. F. Schumacher was a British economist and author. He contributed many articles to the London Times. One of his books, Small Is Beautiful: Economics as if People Mattered became a best-seller.             According to him, the modern world has been shaped by technology and continues to shaped looks sick. We wonder that technology has helped us in many ways, yet the underlying factors of alleviation of poverty and unemployment have not been solved by technology at all. In that case, we have to consider whether it is possible better – a technology with human face.        It’s very strange to say the laws and principles of technology, the product of man, are generally very different from those of human nature of living nature. There is measure in all natural things in their size, speed of violence. The system of nature, which man is a part of it, tends to be selfbalancing, self-adjusting, self-clearing. But, it is not so with technology. It recognizes no self-limit principle in terms of its size, speed, or     violence. It doesn’t possess the virtues of being self-balanced, self-adjusting, self-cleansing. Somehow, man is dominated by technology and specialization. The modern technology acts like a foreign body and it has become inhuman in the subtle system of nature.             In his opinion, the modern technology was involved in three crises simultaneously. First, human nature revolts against suffocating and debilitating inhuman technological patterns. Second, the living environment is partially breakdown.  And the third, it is clear that the inroads of the world’s non-renewable resources have become serious bottlenecks and virtual exhaustion loom ahead in the future.It is the result of materialism and limitless expansionism in a finite environment. It is a big question whether we could develop technology which can solve all our problems, a technology with a human face.                         Technology that lightens our burden would help give us better time to relax and do what we would like, increase our      reativity, work things with our hands that give us joy as defined by Thomas Aquinas. Schumacher explains it is not the actual production of ‘total social time’ spent roughly one-fifth of one-third of one half, that is 3.5 percent and the rest96.5 percent of ‘total social time’ is directly product less.  It pales into insignificance, that it carries no real weight, but alone prestige. Hence, virtually all real production has been turned into an inhuman chore which does not enrich a man but empties him. Taking stock of our goals, everybody would take it a privilege to work usefully, creatively with his own hands and brains can actually produce things and would benefit the society. 
    Schumacher never says that technology in itself is bad. But, he urges us to utilize the scientific techniques that help us get to the truth of the matter and increase our knowledge, to focus on technology that does not lead to giantism, speed, or violence and destruction of humanwork enjoyment. What he instead suggests us is to recapture simplicity in all that we do so as to produce a self-balancing system of nature and a technology to which everybody can use and which is for all.
